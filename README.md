This project analyzes ATP Tour match data (2000–present) to calculate, visualize, and model player performance across different surfaces.

It provides an interpretable Jupyter Notebook that tracks each player’s Elo rating over time, segmented by court type, and explores machine learning approaches to predict match outcomes and assess key performance indicators.
